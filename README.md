# Quotifier
Regular Comments are too mainstream.

## What it does

Quotifier add random quotes to your code. Using breakthroughs in machine learning and big data, it is able to generate fake quotes. It is also smart enough to know how the comment should be formatted for the file type you picked. 

This code will produce beautiful gems such as:

    # It's local on the the remote server - Soulja Boy
    # Those were alternative facts - Undertaker
    # An eye for eye only ends up making the whole world blind. - Operah Winfrey

## How to use

Simply run `python main.py [name of file]` :) 

You can also run it multiple times to add to the fun
